# Setup and Requirements

Before running this analysis, ensure you have:
1. Opened the project in RStudio (`MasterFAA.Rproj`)
2. Installed required packages using `renv::restore()`

```{r setup, echo=TRUE}
# Load required packages
library(dplyr)      # For data manipulation
library(ggplot2)    # For plotting
library(xts)        # For time series
library(vars)       # For VAR modeling
library(knitr)      # For report generation

# Configure output settings
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,     # Don't show code by default
  warning = FALSE,  # Don't show warnings
  message = FALSE,  # Don't show messages
  fig.width = 10,   # Figure width
  fig.height = 6,   # Figure height
  fig.align = "center"
)
```

# Running the Analysis

This document provides an interactive way to explore the MasterFAA analysis results. You can:

1. **View the Analysis**: Click "Knit" to generate a complete HTML report
2. **Explore Code**: Use the code fold buttons (â–¶) to see the R code
3. **Modify Parameters**: Edit code chunks to customize the analysis

The analysis is organized in these main sections:
- EPU Index Construction and Comparison
- Financial Market Analysis
- VAR Model Results
- Key Findings

```{r run_analysis, echo=TRUE}
# Run the full analysis pipeline
source("R/01_data_cleaning.R")  # Clean and prepare data
source("R/02_analysis.R")       # Perform analysis
source("R/03_models.R")         # Run VAR models
source("R/04_visualization.R")  # Create visualizations
```

# Results

## 1. EPU Indices

### Norwegian and Eurozone EPU Comparison

```{r epu_plot, fig.cap="Norwegian and Eurozone EPU Indices (Base Period Mean = 100)"}
knitr::include_graphics("output/figures/epu_indices.png")
```

The figure shows how economic policy uncertainty has evolved in Norway and the Eurozone. Key observations:
- Peaks during major economic events
- Different patterns between regions
- Recent trends and developments

### Relative EPU Analysis

```{r relative_epu_plot, fig.cap="Relative EPU: Norway vs Eurozone"}
knitr::include_graphics("output/figures/relative_epu.png")
```

This shows the difference between Norwegian and Eurozone EPU, highlighting:
- Periods of higher uncertainty in Norway
- Periods of higher uncertainty in the Eurozone
- Regional policy divergence

## 2. Financial Market Analysis

```{r financial_plot, fig.cap="Key Financial Market Indicators", fig.height=8}
# Load the data
vix_data <- readRDS("data/processed/cleaned/vix_data.rds")
oil_data <- readRDS("data/processed/cleaned/oil_data.rds")
exch_data <- readRDS("data/processed/cleaned/exchange_rate.rds")

# Create a multi-panel plot
par(mfrow=c(3,1), mar=c(4,4,2,2))

# VIX Plot
plot(vix_data$Date, vix_data$VIX, 
     type="l", col="darkblue", 
     main="VIX Index (Global Market Volatility)",
     xlab="", ylab="VIX")

# Oil Price Plot
plot(oil_data$Date, oil_data$OilPrice, 
     type="l", col="darkgreen",
     main="Brent Oil Price",
     xlab="", ylab="USD/Barrel")

# Exchange Rate Plot
plot(exch_data$Date, exch_data$EURNOK, 
     type="l", col="darkred",
     main="EUR/NOK Exchange Rate",
     xlab="Date", ylab="Rate")
```

The analysis includes three key financial indicators:
- VIX Index: Global market volatility indicator
- Oil Price: A key factor for the Norwegian economy
- EUR/NOK Exchange Rate: Our main variable of interest

## 3. VAR Model Results

### Impulse Response Analysis

```{r irf_plot, fig.cap="Response of Exchange Rate to EPU Shocks"}
knitr::include_graphics("output/figures/irf_epu.png")
```

The impulse response functions show:
- Initial impact of EPU shocks
- Duration of the effects
- Confidence intervals

### Variance Decomposition

```{r fevd_plot, fig.cap="Variance Decomposition of Exchange Rate Movements"}
knitr::include_graphics("output/figures/fevd.png")
```

This shows the relative importance of different factors in explaining exchange rate movements.

# Key Findings

1. **EPU Effects**
   - Significant impact on exchange rates
   - Different effects from Norwegian vs Eurozone uncertainty
   - Time-varying relationship

2. **Market Interactions**
   - Role of global volatility
   - Oil price importance
   - Policy transmission channels

3. **Policy Implications**
   - Monetary policy considerations
   - Exchange rate management
   - Economic stability factors

# Technical Notes

For those interested in the technical implementation:

```{r technical_details, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Analysis files and their purposes:
# R/01_data_cleaning.R  - Data preparation and cleaning
# R/02_analysis.R       - Main analysis functions
# R/03_models.R         - VAR model estimation
# R/04_visualization.R  - Plot generation
```

# Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates the complex relationship between economic policy uncertainty and exchange rates in Norway and the Eurozone. The results suggest significant interactions between policy uncertainty, global market conditions, and exchange rate dynamics.
